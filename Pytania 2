What is currying?

Currying is when you break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions 
that each take only one argument. Here's an example in JavaScript  

function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add(3, 4); // returns 7

This is a function that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. 
We will now curry this function:

function add (a) {
    return function (b) {
      return a + b;
    }
  }
