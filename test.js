Write a function solution that, given an array A of N integers
(between -100 and 100), returns the sign (-1, 0, 1) of the
product of all the numbers in the array multiplied together.
Assume that N is between 1 and 1000.
For example, given A = [1, -2, -3, 5], the function should return
1 (the multiplication equals 30).
Given A = [1, 2, 3, -5] your function should return -1 (the
multiplication equals -30)
Given A = [1, 2, 0, -5] your function should return O (the
multiplication equals 0).
